# Party management
In today’s world, we folks organize and go to so many parties. Parties like Birthdays,
Marriages, Engagements, Anniversaries, and many more always attract us.
At parties, there is a lot of food being wasted due to people’s preferences. Understand this
thing in a simple manner. Fo example, suppose you like Vegetarian food and there are similar
so many peoples coming to the party like Veg and Non-Veg count is less.So, there is a
chance that Non-Veg food will be wasted.So, Why not develop a Mobile Application based
on Food preferences and the number of people coming to the Party?.This would be great!!
